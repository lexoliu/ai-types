//! Destination checks that keep a fetch pointed at the public internet.
//!
//! The URL this crate fetches is typically chosen by a language model, which
//! may be acting on text from a page it fetched a moment ago. That makes a
//! plain `GET` a server-side request forgery primitive: a model that is merely
//! confused — never mind one that has been prompt-injected — can be talked into
//! fetching `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/`
//! and handing the result back as tool output.
//!
//! Every entry point therefore resolves the host and refuses any address that
//! is not publicly routable. Redirects are not a hole here because the HTTP
//! client is built without redirect-following middleware, so a `302` is
//! returned rather than followed; if that ever changes, each hop must be
//! re-checked through [`guard_url`].
