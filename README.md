A library providing unified trait abstractions for AI models including language models, embedding models, and image generators. This library enables you to write AI-powered applications that are agnostic to specific AI service providers.

## Features

- **üö´ `no_std` compatible** - Works in embedded and resource-constrained environments
- **üîß Provider agnostic** - Unified traits for different AI model types
- **‚ö° Async/await support** - Built on modern Rust async primitives
- **üõ†Ô∏è Tool system** - Support for function calling and tool use
- **üì∏ Multimodal** - Support for text, images, and embeddings

## Supported Model Types
- LLM
- Embedding model
- Text-to-image model

## Quick Start

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ai_types = "0.0.1"
```
