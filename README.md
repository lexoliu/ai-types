A library providing unified trait abstractions for AI models including language models, embedding models, image generators, and audio processing models. This library enables you to write AI-powered applications that are agnostic to specific AI service providers.

## Features

- **üö´ `no_std` compatible** - Works in embedded and resource-constrained environments
- **üîß Provider agnostic** - Unified traits for different AI model types
- **‚ö° Async/await support** - Built on modern Rust async primitives
- **üõ†Ô∏è Tool system** - Support for function calling and tool use
- **üì∏ Multimodal** - Support for text, images, embeddings, and audio
- **üéµ Audio processing** - Unified interface for audio generation and transcription

## Supported Model Types
- **LLM** - Large Language Models for text generation and conversation
- **Embedding model** - Text and multimodal embedding generation
- **Text-to-image model** - Image generation from text prompts
- **Audio generation** - Text-to-speech and audio synthesis
- **Audio transcription** - Speech-to-text and audio transcription

## Quick Start

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ai_types = "0.0.1"
```
